Biology for Engineers</b><br>



[3 credit course; 2 (one hour) lectures and one (one hour) tutorial per week. Only lecture hours are
shown] <br/><br/>

<span style="color:red;">Module 1.</span> (2 hours)- Introduction
Purpose: To convey that Biology is as important a scientific discipline as Mathematics, Physics and
Chemistry
Bring out the fundamental differences between science and engineering by drawing a comparison
between eye and camera, Bird flying and aircraft. Mention the most exciting aspect of biology as an
independent scientific discipline. Why we need to study biology? Discuss how biological
observations of 18th Century that lead to major discoveries. Examples from Brownian motion and
the origin of thermodynamics by referring to the original observation of Robert Brown and Julius
Mayor. These examples will highlight the fundamental importance of observations in any scientific
inquiry. <br/><br/>

<span style="color:red;">Module 2.</span> (3 hours)- Classification
Purpose: To convey that classification per se is not what biology is all about. The underlying
criterion, such as morphological, biochemical or ecological be highlighted. Hierarchy of life forms at
phenomenological level. A common thread weaves this hierarchy Classification. Discuss
classification based on (a) cellularity- Unicellular or multicellular (b) ultrastructure- prokaryotes or
eucaryotes. (c) energy and Carbon utilization -Autotrophs, heterotrophs, lithotropes (d) Ammonia
excretion – aminotelic, uricoteliec, ureotelic (e) Habitata- acquatic or terrestrial (e) Molecular
taxonomy- three major kingdoms of life. A given organism can come under different category based
on classification. Model organisms for the study of biology come from different groups. E.coli, S.
cerevisiae, D. Melanogaster, C. elegance, A. Thaliana, M. musculus 
<br/><br/>

<span style="color:red;">Module 3.</span> (4 hours)-Genetics
Purpose: To convey that “Genetics is to biology what Newton’s laws are to Physical Sciences”
Mendel’s laws, Concept of segregation and independent assortment. Concept of allele. Gene
mapping, Gene interaction, Epistasis. Meiosis and Mitosis be taught as a part of genetics. Emphasis
to be give not to the mechanics of cell division nor the phases but how genetic material passes from
parent to offspring. Concepts of recessiveness and dominance. Concept of mapping of phenotype togenes. Discuss about the single gene disorders in humans. Discuss the concept of complementation
using human genetics. <br/><br/>

<span style="color:red;">Module 4.</span> (4 hours)-Biomolecules
Purpose: To convey that all forms of life has the same building blocks and yet the manifestations
are as diverse as one can imagine
Molecules of life. In this context discuss monomeric units and polymeric structures. Discuss about
sugars, starch and cellulose. Amino acids and proteins. Nucleotides and DNA/RNA. Two carbon
units and lipids. <br/><br/>

<span style="color:red;">Module 5.</span> (4 Hours). Enzymes
Purpose: To convey that without catalysis life would not have existed on earth
Enzymology: How to monitor enzyme catalyzed reactions. How does an enzyme catalyzereactions.
Enzyme classification. Mechanism of enzyme action. Discuss at least two examples. Enzyme kinetics
and kinetic parameters. Why should we know these parameters to understand biology? RNA
catalysis. <br/><br/>

<span style="color:red;">Module 6.</span> (4 hours)- Information Transfer
Purpose: The molecular basis of coding and decoding genetic information is universal Molecular
basis of information transfer. DNA as a genetic material. Hierarchy of DNA structure- from single
stranded to double helix to nucleosomes. Concept of genetic code. Universality and degeneracy of
genetic code. Define gene in terms of complementation and recombination. <br/><br/>

<span style="color:red;">Module 7.</span> (5 hours). Macromolecular analysis
Purpose: How to analyses biological processes at the reductionistic level
Proteins- structure and function. Hierarch in protein structure. Primary secondary, tertiary and
quaternary structure. Proteins as enzymes, transporters, receptors and structural elements. <br/><br/>

<span style="color:red;">Module 8.</span> (4 hours)- Metabolism
Purpose: The fundamental principles of energy transactions are the same in physical and biological
world.
Thermodynamics as applied to biological systems. Exothermic and endothermic versus endergonic
and exergoinc reactions. Concept of Keq and its relation to standard free energy. Spontaneity. ATP
as an energy currency. This should include the breakdown of glucose to CO2 + H2O (Glycolysis and
Krebs cycle) and synthesis of glucose from CO2 and H2O (Photosynthesis). Energy yielding and
energy consuming reactions. Concept of Energy charge<br/><br/>

<span style="color:red;">Module 9.</span> (3 hours)- Microbiology
Concept of single celled organisms. Concept of species and strains. Identification and classification
of microorganisms. Microscopy. Ecological aspects of single celled organisms. Sterilization and
media compositions. Growth kinetics. <br/><br/>

<span style="color:red;">Module 10:</span> Plant Physiology covering, Transpiration; Mineral nutrition (3 Lectures) <br/><br/>

<span style="color:red;">Module 10B:</span> Ecology covering, Ecosystems- Components, types, flow of matter and energy in an
ecosystem; Community ecology- Characteristics, frequency, life forms, and biological spectrum;
Ecosystem structure- Biotic and a-biotic factors, food chain, food web, ecological pyramids; (3
Lectures) <br/><br/>
