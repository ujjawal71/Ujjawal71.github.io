The objective of this Course is to introduce to continuum mechanics and material modelling
of engineering materials based on first energy principles: deformation and strain; momentum
balance, stress and stress states; elasticity and elasticity bounds; plasticity and yield design.
The overarching theme is a unified mechanistic language using thermodynamics, which
allows understanding, modelling and design of a large range of engineering materials. The
subject of mechanics of materials involves analytical methods for determining the strength,
stiffness (deformation characteristics), and stability of the various members in a structural
system. The behaviour of a member depends not only on the fundamental laws that govern
the equilibrium of forces, but also on the mechanical characteristics of the material. These
mechanical characteristics come from the laboratory, where materials are tested under
accurately known forces and their behaviour is carefully observed and measured. For this
reason, mechanics of materials is a blended science of experiment and Newtonian postulates
of analytical mechanics.<br/><br/>

The objective of this Course is to deal with an experimental determination and
evaluation of mechanical characteristics and advanced behavior of metallic and nonmetallic structural materials. The course deals with explanation of deformation and
fracture behavior of structural materials. The main goal of this course is to provide
students with all information concerning principle, way of measurement, as well as
practical application of mechanical characteristics.<br/>

1 Make measurements of behavior of various materials used in Civil Engineering.<br/>
2 Provide physical observations to complement concepts learnt<br/>
3 Introduce experimental procedures and common measurement
instruments, equipment, devices.<br/>
4 Exposure to a variety of established material testing procedures and techniques<br/>
5 Different methods of evaluation and inferences drawn from observations
The course reviews also the current testing technology and examines force applications
systems, force measurement, strain measurement, important instrument considerations,
equipment for environmental testing, and computers applications for materials testing
provide an introductory treatment of basic skills in material engineering towards (i)
selecting material for the design, and (ii) evaluating the mechanical and structural
properties of material, as well as the knowledge necessary for a civil engineer. The
knowledge acquired lays a good foundation for analysis and design of various civil
engineering structures/systems in a reliable manner.
