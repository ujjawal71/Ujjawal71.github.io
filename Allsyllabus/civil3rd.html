<span id="8" style='display:none'><p > <br><b>Introduction to Civil Engineering</b><br/>
<br/><br/>
When the students enter the college to pursue a degree in Civil Engineering and as well pursue a career in Civil
Engineering after graduation, they need to understand the breadth and depth available in this field for possible
engagement. When many alternative disciplines of engineering appear to offer apparently more glamourous
avenues for advancement, the Civil Engineering student should realize the solid foundations available in this
mother of all engineering disciplines. The students should understand the enormous possibilities available for
creative and innovative works in this all pervasive field of engineering. <br/><br/>

<b>This course is designed to address the following:</b><br/><br/>
• to give an understanding to the students of the vast breadth and numerous areas of engagement
available in the overall field of Civil Engineering
<br/><br/>
• to motivate the student to pursue a career in one of the many areas of Civil Engineering with deep
interest and keenness.
<br/><br/>
• To expose the students to the various avenues available for doing creative and innovative work in this
field by showcasing the many monuments and inspiring projects of public utility.
