    <br/><br/>

The objective of this Course is to introduce to continuum mechanics and material modeling of
engineering materials based on first energy principles: deformation and strain; momentum
balance, stress and stress states; elasticity and elasticity bounds; plasticity and yield design. The
overarching theme is a unified mechanistic language using thermodynamics, which allows
understanding, modelling and design of a large range of engineering materials. The subject of
mechanics of materials involves analytical methods for determining the strength, stiffness
(deformation characteristics), and stability of the various members in a structural system. The
behavior of a member depends not only on the fundamental laws that govern the equilibrium of
forces, but also on the mechanical characteristics of the material. These mechanical
characteristics come from the laboratory, where materials are tested under accurately known
forces and their behavior is carefully observed and measured (learnt in the previous course on
Materials, Testing & Evaluation). For this reason, mechanics of materials is a blended science of
experiment and Newtonian postulates of analytical mechanics.
What will I learn? <br/><br/>
1. Understand the deformation and strains under different load action and response in terms of
forces and moments<br/><br/>
2. Understand the behaviour under different loading actions<br/><br/>
3. Application of engineering principles to calculate the reactions, forces and moments<br/><br/>
4. Understand the energy methods used to derive the equations to solve engineering problems<br/><br/>
5. Make use of the capabilities to determine the forces and moments for design
